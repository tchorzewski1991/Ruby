# ruby-scripts
The main point of this repo is to practise different techniques of programming in ruby language.
For practise, I will focus on algorithms implementation itself, rather than using built-in ruby features.
Not every subdirectory contain scripts with minimum usage of ruby API.
### Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Recursive/Iterative fibonacci
- Hamming distance
- Levenshtein distance
- Jaro distance

### Data Structures
- Linked List (with basic actions)
- Circular List (with basic actions)

### Others
- Occurence counting (differen approaches)
