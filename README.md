# ruby-scripts
This repo refers to my private '100 days of code' challenge. The main point is to practise different techniques of programming in ruby language. 
For practise, I will  focus on algorithms implementation itself, rather than using built-in ruby features. 
Not every subdirectory contain scripts with minimum usage of ruby API.
### Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Linear search

### Data Structures
- Linked List (with basic actions)

### Others
- Occurence counting (differen approaches)
