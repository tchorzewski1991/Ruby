# ruby-scripts
The main point of this repo is to practise different techniques of programming in ruby language.
For practise, I will focus on algorithms implementation itself, rather than using built-in ruby features.
Not every subdirectory contain scripts with minimum usage of ruby API.

### Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Recursive/Iterative fibonacci
- Hamming distance
- Levenshtein distance [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
- Jaro distance [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)
- Jaro-Winkler distance
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt string searching
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm)

### Data Structures
- Linked List (with basic actions)
- Circular List (with basic actions)

### Others
- Occurence counting (differen approaches)
